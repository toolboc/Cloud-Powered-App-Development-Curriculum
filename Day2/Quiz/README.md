Name:

1. In class, we deployed an instance of WordPress to Microsoft Azure using Platform as a Service.  The deployment rendered appropriately because WordPress is written in the PHP programming language which is a supported technology on Azure PaaS.  

	Here is a condensed version of why this works:
	
	1.) PaaS is essentially a pre-configured OS environment that has support for certain technologies, for example PHP
	
	2.) If we put PHP code on the server in an appropriate way, it should execute since PHP is available
	
	Now consider, the Prolog programming language is not supported on Azure PaaS.  That said, there are ways to deploy / run  Prolog applications into Microsoft Azure.  
	
	Similar to above, in 2 steps, describe how you might run a Prolog application on Microsoft Azure (Hint: IaaS)?
