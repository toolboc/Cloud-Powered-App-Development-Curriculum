
## Create a Responsive and  Scalable Website Assignment    

Before the next session it is important that you wrap up work on your website and get it in a presentable form.  It is understandable that you may not have much in terms of content.  I am hoping that you have something that can serve as a foundation for building upon in the future.  
 
At minimum, your website should have:
 1. A clear purpose 
 2. A non-default theme 
 3. Two Pages or Posts of content 
 4. An about page 
 5. Employ an external plug-in 
 6. Support viewing on Mobile devices 
 
That said, I encourage you to challenge yourself and see what you can create!  Please have fun and explore!  Your website will serve as the basis for your final class presentation!
