Name:

1. Object detection algorithms (which are very math intensive to create from scratch) can often be trained by providing sample inputs in the form of tagged images.  Imagine that you are tasked to create an object detection model that detects squirrels on UH campus.  How might you go about gathering samples?  What would you do to ensure your model can detect squirrels at night?

2. Graphical Processing Units are really good at performing vectorized mathematical operations in addition to other optimizations like shared memory access which makes them capable of performing certain tasks much better than any off-the-shelf CPU.  Most of us have witnessed CPUs shrink to very small sizes during the era of mobile phones, particularly during the rise of Android/iOS.  Some might notice similarities occurring in the GPU space at this very moment!  Consider how shrinking CPUs over the last 20 years impacted your daily life, how might you imagine the shrinking of GPUs changing your life over the next 20 years?
