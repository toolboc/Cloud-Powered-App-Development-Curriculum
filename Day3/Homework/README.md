Today you have learned about the exciting world of the Internet of Things.  Now it is your turn to create a compelling IoT solution! 

  At minimum, your idea should have:  

1. A clear purpose  
2. Compelling description  
3. Diagram detailing intended functionality 
4. List of any required parts (to best of your ability) 
 
That said, I encourage you to challenge yourself to see what you can create!  Please have fun and enjoy!
