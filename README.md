## Description   

The course will cover: (a) Cloud Services - The primary technology focus will be on the Microsoft Azure Platform and cover scalable services / websites / virtual machines; (b) Cross Platform Mobile Development – Design considerations and code sharing techniques used in developing apps which target multiple platforms.  The primary methods employed will include native app creation and web wrapping; (c) Internet of Things using hardware devices to publish and present data in the cloud. (d) Current trending topics in technology including blockchain

## Expectations and Goals   

Take a closer look at the description above.  That's right, in addition to creating a scalable website we will create a Cross-Platform application, and connect an IoT device to the cloud to produce real-time telemetry as part of this course!  We will also have time to cover the mechanisms behind cryptocurrencies!  Do not worry, we will use templates and tools to facilitate most projects to ensure that you are successful in understanding and applying the concepts that are covered.

The course style will be lecture based with hands-on-labs and online modules selected from Microsoft Learn.  The lecture content will cover overviews of cloud concepts, web development basics, design methodologies, and app marketing strategies.  The majority of the grade is reliant upon successful completion of the course projects and a final presentation.  
 
## Online Materials
The course instruction materials can be found online @ https://aka.ms/cloudpoweredappdev

## Optional Materials
A personal machine capable of running the development tools. 

## Daily Requirements

Check the Folder for the corresponding class day for a summary of all presentation content, quizzes, homework, and MS Learn
Modules.  You will want to make sure all homework and quizzes are completed before class the next day.  MS Learn Modules *should* be completed on the day assigned, although you may work on them at your leisure which includes skipping ahead as well as postponing.  Be warned that letting these pile up could make for a very stressful evening before final presentations.  I will check all students for completion of these modules at the beginning of the last day of class.
