## Description   

The course will cover: (a) Cloud Services - The primary technology focus will be on the Microsoft Azure Platform and cover scalable services / websites / virtual machines; (b) Platform as a Service offerings to support scalable web development / deployment with WordPress on Azure.  (c) Introduction to AI concepts including computer vision and the development of custom object detection models.  (d) Internet of Things applications using GPU accelerated embedded devices to employ object detection models and publish inference results to the cloud.

## Expectations and Goals   

Take a closer look at the description above.  That's right, in addition to creating a scalable website we will create artificially intelligent object detection models, and deploy AI workloads onto GPU-accelerated IoT devices to publish inference results into the Azure Cloud as part of this course!  In addition, we will provide access to guest presenters from NVIDIA, Zenus.ai, and Microsoft to facilitate live discussion with industry experts in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things .  Do not worry about prerequisites, we will use templates and tools to facilitate course assignments to ensure that you are successful in understanding and applying the concepts that are covered.

The course style will be lecture based with hands-on-labs and online modules selected from Microsoft Learn.  The lecture content will cover overviews of cloud concepts, web development basics, design methodologies, AI concepts, and the Internet of Things.  The majority of the grade is reliant upon successful completion of the course projects and a final presentation.  
 
## Online Materials
The course instruction materials can be found online @ https://aka.ms/cloudpoweredappdev

## Optional Materials
A personal machine capable of running the development tools. 

## Daily Requirements

Check the Folder for the corresponding class day for a summary of all presentation content, quizzes, homework, and MS Learn
Modules.  You will want to make sure all homework and quizzes are completed before class the next day.  MS Learn Modules *should* be completed on the day assigned, although you may work on them at your leisure which includes skipping ahead as well as postponing.  Be warned that letting these pile up could make for a very stressful evening before final presentations.  I will check all students for completion of these modules at the beginning of the last day of class.
